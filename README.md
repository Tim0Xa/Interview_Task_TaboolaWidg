Taboola Interveiw Task


There is an example of Taboola coding interview.
The task was:
	Part 1:
Marketing wants to be able to customize the content in the Content Bank over time.
Using your favorite framework (or no framework if you prefer), create a web app that
will allow Marketing to create and maintain this content collection in a database.
Marketing wants to be able to filter the sample items by country (US, France, Germany)
and by brand name (Wikibuy, Amazon, HelloFresh, etc.), and have one or more creative sets
(title + thumbnail image) within each brand name. They should be able to create new items,
save them to the database, and later edit or delete them. Start with the included sample data.

	Part 2:
Create a page that presents a standard widget layout (2 rows of 3 items each as seen above)
that allows the user to place selected items from the content bank you made in Part 1 into 
a position of the user's choice.
